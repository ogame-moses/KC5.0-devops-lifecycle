#DevOps is a set of practices, tools, and a cultural philosophy that aims to improve collaboration and automate processes between software development(DEV) and IT operations(Ops) teams.it is practice widely adopted in modern software development to improve efficiency, reliability, and collaboration.

#Core principles

--Collaboration:
DevOps fosters a culture of collaboration between development (Dev) and operations (Ops) teams, breaking down silos and improving open communication.

--Automation:
It emphasizes automating repetitive tasks such as testing, deployment, and monitoring to  reduce manual intervention and human error conversely increasing efficiency

--Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):
  automate the integration and deployment of code, i.e enhancement of iterative processes, tools and workflows
allowing for faster and more reliable releases.

--Monitoring and Logging:
Continuous monitoring and logging help  detect issues early and maintain system stability 



#DevOps Lifecycle Stages

Planning
--Define project goals and requirements, and create a roadmap for development

Development
--Write and review code, ensuring it meets the project's standards

Building
--Compile and integrate code into executable code/artifacts

Testing
--Identify and fix defects through automated and manual testing

Release
--this stage witnesses preparing artifacts, approvals, change management etc

Deployment
--release the software to staging or production environments

Operations
--Manage and operate the software in production, ensuring it runs smoothly and available

Monitoring
--involve Tracking performance and health of the software, identifying any issues and collect logs
